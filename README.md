# macOS Dev Setup

This document describes how I set up my developer environment on a new MacBook or iMac. We will set up [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript/TypeScript). You may not need for your projects, although I recommend having it set up as they always come in handy.

The script were tested on **macOS Big Sur** (11.6), but should work for more recent versions as well.
